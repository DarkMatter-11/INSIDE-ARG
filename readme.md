# INSIDE ARG Documentation

This repository is meant to keep a public record of most events and relevant discoveries and progress in solving the mysteries of this [ARG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game). Thus making it easier to jump in on it while it's ongoing and contribute in helping solve it.

April 20th note: This is all still very green and needs quite a bit of info for it to be actually useful.

## About INSIDE & the ARG

INSIDE is a [video game](https://playdead.com/games/inside) made by Playdead and first released in June 29, 2016. (Here is a [full playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4MkqbKieU))

Early on, hidden things were discovered in the game. Some of these lead us to secret websites and other clues and puzzles started happening outside of the game.
Playdead has been hinting at their upcoming game with it.

The ongoing effort to solve the puzzles and mysteries is happening at the unofficial Playdead Discord server: https://discord.gg/gQ74gaa

### Collector's Edition Stickers

Playdead in collaboration with iam8bit made a special collector's edition (hereby referred to as CE) limited to 1000 copies.

It started to be received by December 12, 2019. That's when iam8bit released this making of video, revealing the content of the CE which was previously unknown: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vG2A0BjMiY

And this is the final result itself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhCdGdqCIRU

The **stickers** that seal the wrapping contain a puzzle.

These is what those stickers look like:

The community has since been trying to get detailed pictures of each. These are pictures of most of those: https://imgur.com/a/YpqizlW

This is what we know so far:

- Each sticker has a unique three digit number (supposedly that would be the copy number, from 001, or 000 to 999)
- Each sticker has one of three symbols: a dot, a slash or a dash.
- Each sticker has one of nine different texture images. (We have identified them with letters, from A to I)

The effort to track down as many different copies of the CE as possible, is being recorded in this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ccgEU722Kz5kDrq0wmA5pd6Du05qAaWNN7kRaTlG9jU/edit

#### Three symbols

The symbols (a [dot](https://i.imgur.com/RvKX4CI.jpg), a [dash](https://i.imgur.com/LaZ3Fg4.jpg) and a [slash](https://i.imgur.com/v290XRN.jpg)), which had been previously used in the [printer strings](https://wiki.gamedetectives.net/index.php?title=Inside_ARG#Printer_Strings) might reveal another message or code. We have yet to find several consecutively numbered stickers, since that might be the order needed to arrange them. If this is the case, it is expected that it won't be required to gather ALL the stickers (many of them have already been confirmed to have been lost or thrown away), but rather a much smaller number of them (or so we hope!).

For instance, if the string was of 10 characters long, it could have been repeated 100 times to give it a very good margin of error. However, so far the printer strings have been far longer than that (often 32 characters long, across many lines).

#### The 9 texture images

Underneath the symbol of the sticker, there is one of nine different image textures comprised of little dots (which depending on the distance and angle, can be hard to be seen). When arranged together solving the mini-puzzle, an image is formed.

### Terminal 41 hidden JPG image (aka 534brn9653f9j8mmd puzzle)

In the URL: http://terminal41.link/dat/534brn9653f9j8mmd/ there was an HTML page with code for what seems to be a JPG image file.

### PS4 cover hidden mystery

On twitter, iam8bit (makers of the CE) [tweeted](https://twitter.com/iam8bit/status/1203007268930764800) explicitly stating that there is something hidden in the reversible cover of their PS4 edition of INSIDE.

This may be the same for their [individual PS4 physical copy](https://www.iam8bit.com/products/inside-ps4-physical-game), for which they state there is *"perhaps, more than it seems"*.
