# INSIDE ARG Documentation

This repository is meant to keep a public record of most events and relevant discoveries and progress in solving the mysteries of this [ARG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game). Thus making it easier to jump in on it while it's ongoing and contribute in helping solve it.

## About INSIDE & the ARG

INSIDE is a [video game](https://playdead.com/games/inside) made by Playdead and first released in June 29, 2016.

Early on, hidden things were discovered in the game. Some of these lead us to secret websites and other clues and puzzles started happening outside of the game.
Playdead has been hinting at their upcoming game with it.

The ongoing effort to solve the puzzles and mysteries is happening at the unofficial Playdead Discord server: https://discord.gg/gQ74gaa

### Collector's Edition Stickers

Playdead in collaboration with iam8bit made a special collector's edition (hereby referred to as CE) limited to 1000 copies.

It started to be received by December 12, 2019. That's when iam8bit released this making of video, revealing the content of the CE which was previously unknown: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vG2A0BjMiY
